# Explanation
- Prime numbers are the positive integers having only two factors, 1 and the integer itself.

- Imagine **n** is the number to be checked.

- So to check whether **n** is prime, we've to check for any factors of **n** from 2 to n-1.

- In this case the time complexity is **O(n)**.

- Actually we don't have to check upto the n-1. We just have to check upto floor value of n/2

- Consider n = 15, floor value of n/2 becomes 7. So we will check from 2 to 7. 

- Imagine we are checking till 8. But 8 * 2 = 16. So there is no chance for 8 to be a factor of 15. This is the same case with all numbers greater than 7.

- Now the time complexity is decreased to **O(n/2)**.

- Thus by this method we can check whether a number is prime or not, more efficiently.
